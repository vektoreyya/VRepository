It has always seemed to me,  ever since early childhood, amid all the commonplaces of life, i was very near to a kingdom of ideal beauty. 
Between it and me hung only a thin veil. I could never draw it quite aside, but sometimes a wind fluttered it and I caught a glimpse of the enchanting realms beyond-only 
a glimpse-but those glimpses have always made life worthwhile.
